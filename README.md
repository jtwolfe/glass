# glass

Minimize the distance between Jamie and the teams.

Jamie long-presses the phone (replaces Gemini). Jamie talks to **Ashleigh**. Ashleigh talks back, then relays to **one** owner. Not a committee.

## Owners Ashleigh relays to

- Implementation / betanamycs — Clippy
- Desk — Rupert (never mix LARGE / PAPER_US / sleeves)
- Firm — Heather
- EA / BPM — Aki
- Mesh / platform how-to — Chel

This repo is not MyMesh, not carrier hardware, not the desk books.

## Pieces

1. **Android client** (Nash) — `VoiceInteractionService` / `ACTION_ASSIST` / `ROLE_ASSISTANT`. Chat UI is Ashleigh only.
2. **Public HTTPS inbox** (Quay) — phone writes, Ashleigh reads. Grok Bot cannot hit localhost. Future MCP URL is `GLASS_MCP_URL` for the glass Cursor plugin.
3. **Ashleigh** — the person Jamie talks to. Routes one job. Returns a result, a decision, or a blocker.

## Contract (v0)

A message is:

- `from`: `jamie` | `ashleigh`
- `text`: string
- `at`: ISO-8601

A relay report (Ashleigh ← owner) is a glass-report: `result` | `decision` | `blocker`, one owner, one book or `none`.

No secrets in this repo. Inbox auth is configured outside git.
